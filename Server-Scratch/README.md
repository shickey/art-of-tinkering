This is a modified instance of [scratch-gui](https://github.com/llk/scratch-gui).  

It includes WebSocket hooks for hot-loading Sprites and a modified "fullscreen" button which uses the [Presentation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Presentation_API) for outputting to an external monitor.
